I love to learn, and I hope that some of the projects found on the <a class="border-b-2 border-blue-500 font-medium" href="/projects/">Builds</a> page of this site are good examples of what I've made throughout that process. The page you're currently reading is more of a long form resume if you need some more of the details.

Back in 2007 I completed the requirements to become an Eagle Scout. I'm still proud of it today, and have enjoyed a lifetime of enjoying the use of skills I learned and friends I made and continue to make through Scouting.

In 2012 I graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in Zoology/Marine Biology. In the process of getting that degree, I bounced between a lot of different majors: political science, Spanish, fish and wildlife management, and finally marine biology. Eventually I made it out of that place with a B.S. in Zoology with a concentration in Marine Biology.

I also hold two specializations in Natural Resources Recreation and Marine Ecosystems Management.

2015 I started learning web development in earnest again through freeCodeCamp and various online teachers and courses. <span class="text-xs">(I have my favorites if you need recommendations.)</span>

Lately I've been picking the <abbr title="MongoDB Express Vue Node">MEVN</abbr> stack to really learn it well, but also checking in on Postgres for a SQL database in my quiver, Node/Express apps with Nunjucks as a "standard" server side framework, and learning Eleventy to deliver high quality, bare minimum static sites like this one.

I'm really getting interested and excited with DevOps stuff like Docker, self-hosting (I play with Raspberry Pis), and fun nonsense like that. I host my production sites on a Digital Ocean droplet if they need a server, or Netlify if they are static.

I like to live simply and experiment wrecklessly with web technologies, and fishing.

I write about fishing, learning web development, and other things probably.
