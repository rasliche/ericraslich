I love to learn, and I hope that some of the projects found on the <a class="border-b-2 border-blue-500 hover:pb-0.5 font-medium" href="/projects/">Builds</a> page of this site are good examples of what I've made throughout that process. The page you're currently reading is more of a long form resume if you need some more of the details.

Back in 2007 I completed the requirements to become an Eagle Scout. I'm still proud of it today, and have enjoyed a lifetime of enjoying the use of skills I learned and friends I made and continue to make through Scouting.

In 2012 I graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in Zoology/Marine Biology. In the process of getting that degree, I bounced between a lot of different majors: political science, Spanish, fish and wildlife management, and finally marine biology. Eventually I made it out of that place with a B.S. in Zoology with a concentration in Marine Biology. I also hold two specializations in Natural Resources Recreation and Marine Ecosystems Management.

2015 I started learning web development in earnest again through freeCodeCamp and various online teachers and courses. <span class="text-xs">(I have my favorites if you need recommendations.)</span>

Lately I've been working with the Nuxt as my go-to full-stack framework with Postgres for a database and learning Eleventy to deliver high quality, fast, and accessible static sites (like this one).

I'm really getting interested and excited experimenting with DevOps technologies like Docker, self-hosting (I play with Raspberry Pi <abbr title="single-board computers">SBCs</abbr>), and am working to build out my homelab. I host my production sites on a Digital Ocean droplet if they need a server, or Netlify if they are static.

In my free time I play with amateur radio, love to fly fish, work in the garden when it's warm, and go hiking with my family and dog.
