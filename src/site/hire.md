I am excitedly back in the job market!

If you need someone excited to come to work every day, that always wants to learn more, doesn't shy away from responsibility, and likes to stay on the forefront of technology while keeping things accessible to colleagues and customers, I just might be the best hire for your company.

I'd love to talk about roles from front-line tech support to full-stack web developer to project manager to cybersecurity analyst, or anything in that general realm of work. 

If you're just looking for a one-off brochure website for your store or restaurant, you can hire me to build your website or web app.

If for some reason you need someone to move your yacht, sailboat, or work on your 12v system on your bass boat, I also hold a 50 Ton Masters captain license.
