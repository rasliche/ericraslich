I am excitedly back in the job market!

If you want someone excited to come to work every day, that always wants to learn more, doesn't shy away from responsibility, and likes to stay on the forefront of technology while keeping things accessible to colleagues and customers, I think I'd be a great hire for your company.

My former coworkers would say I am *dependable*, a *creative* problem solver, *fun* to work with, and *personable*. They would tell you I was always ready to help out with a mission if I was available and do it safely and efficiently.

I'd love to talk about roles from front-line tech support to full-stack web developer to project manager to cybersecurity analyst. 

If you're a small-medium business owner looking for a brochure website for your store or restaurant, you can hire me to build your website. One of my strengths is translating what matters to your business outcomes into an accessible, fast website that gets customers the information they need when they need it.

If for some reason you need someone to move your yacht, sailboat, or work on the DC electrical system on your bass boat, I also hold a 50 Ton Masters captain license and know my way around a bilge and bus bars.
