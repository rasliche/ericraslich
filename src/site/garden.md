# Garden

## A Discord Experiment

I started a <a class="border-blue-300 border-b" href="https://discord.gg/8XTrpTF">Discord server</a> to for pair programming for web developers.
    
I mostly use a MEVN stack, so feel free to hop on there if you want to pair program for a bit.


## I'll plant something here to grow

I'm not sure exactly what I'll put here eventually. But it seems like a garden is something I should tend.

I do it in real life, I'll do it here as well.

Right now I'm really struggling to get started on a side project after a day of working on work projects.

That doesn't feel like it is going to be a good thing. For now, I just want to let that sink in and let it move on.

In the mean time, I am going to work harder and earlier. While my girlfriend is getting ready for work in the morning (she has to commute), I'll work on my side projects.
