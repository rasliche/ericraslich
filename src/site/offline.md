# Well, heck.

It looks like you're offline and couldn't reach the page you were after.

But isn't it cool you can still get anywhere at all? That's because my site is offline-first and and I want you to be able to get to it anytime. It's just another cool feature I'm happy to help you put on your site when we [work together](/hire/).
