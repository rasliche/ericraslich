title: "Raspberry Pi 4B"
tags: ['Tech']
summary: "A next gen single-board computer, a ton of fun to play with because it's actually not that slow. I've got it running an Ubuntu server. This is the new Ethereum node. It's also great for running docker containers."

A Raspberry Pi is an awesome tool to have in your toolbox. It's a Single-Board Computer (SBC) that anyone can setup and get using. It's a way to get a desktop (or mobile??) linux computer that fits in your pocket for ~$60.
