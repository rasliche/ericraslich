summary: "These are such a great bang-for-your-buck pair of wireless headphones. They're basically disposable but definitely don't sound like it."

I use these headphones almost daily and they've become an indispensible part of what goes into my bag when I leave the house.

My purchase history says I've had them for a little over a year. The battery doesn't last *quite* as long as it did in the beginning, but it's still pretty great. I can get several hours of listening, and if it dies it charges up in about 15 minutes. That's plenty of time to last a flight, bike ride, or run.
