summary: "This SBC is a powerhouse. I use it to serve files on my local network, block ads, and run an Ethereum node. It's a great scratchpad for hosting websites locally in a staging configuration."

A Raspberry Pi is an awesome tool to have in your toolbox. It's a Single-Board Computer (SBC) that anyone can setup and get using. It's a way to get a desktop (or mobile??) linux computer that fits in your pocket for ~$60.

Mine runs a file server on my local network, blocks ads using Pi Hole, and serves as a full Ethereum node to support that decentralized network.
