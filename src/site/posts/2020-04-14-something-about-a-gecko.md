subtitle: Lots of critters in our neighborhood.

<p class="w-full">I'm fortunate to live in a wonderful neighborhood. Since a little before the shutdown of the county I've been working from home and it has allowed for all sorts of wildlife viewing opportunities. We constantly have deer all over (seriously, they're like rats), iguanas, bees, snakes, turtles, birds, and these invasive day geckos like in the picture below.</p>

<p class="w-full">We also noticed a lot of bee activiity lately. Both in these beautiful flowers when it's not so windy, and up in the tops of the tallest palm trees. Today we were watching them get blown out of the treetops in a bee cloud and then swarm their way back in when the wind relented momentarily.</p>
