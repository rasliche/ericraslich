I'm excited to be making decent strides learning about web development
so far. I started casually looking into programming back in 2015, first
by trying to teach myself, then finding
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>.

Since then I've picked up quite a few tricks and am really trying to get
a full stack of technologies under my belt in order to find a good fit
somewhere.

My favorite things to work with are
- Vue
- Tailwind
- Express
- MongoDB

And the things I'm working on picking up now are *way* out of that standard
tech stack
- Docker
- Self-hosting
- Linux / Raspberry Pi
- Networking
