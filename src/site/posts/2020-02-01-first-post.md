<p class="w-full">I'm excited to be making decent strides learning about web development
so far. I started casually looking into programming back in 2015, first
by trying to teach myself, then finding
<a class="border-b-2 border-blue-500" href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>.</p>

<p>Since then I've picked up quite a few tricks and am really trying to get
a full stack of technologies under my belt in order to find a good fit
somewhere.</p>

<p>My favorite tools to work with at the moment are <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue</a>, <a>Tailwind</a>, <a>Express</a>, and <a>MongoDB</a>.</p>

<p>And the things I'm working on picking up now are some alternative tech stacks and DevOps tools like <a>Docker</a>, <a>PostgreSQL</a>, <a>Linux</a>, <a>Raspberry Pi</a>, and general networking and self-hosting skills.</p>
