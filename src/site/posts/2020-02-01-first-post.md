I'm excited to be making decent strides learning about web development so far. I started casually looking into programming back in 2015, first by trying to teach myself, then finding freeCodeCamp.org.

Since then I've picked up quite a few tricks and am really trying to get a full stack of technologies under my belt in order to find a good fit somewhere.

My favorite tools to work with at the moment are Vue, Tailwind, Express, and MongoDB.

And the things I'm working on picking up now are some alternative tech stacks and DevOps tools like Docker, PostgreSQL, Linux, Raspberry Pi, and general networking and self-hosting skills.
