## a little background

If you weren't aware (and you shouldn't be!), this site was built with [Eleventy](11ty.dev). It is an incredibly awesome static site generator built by [Zach Leatherman](zachleat.com).

Something I've been wanting to do is get on those sweet 11ty Leaderboards and just generally get better at building good, accessible, performant and progressive websites.

Zach released this awesome tool called [Speedlify](zachleat.com/web/speedlify), so I tried to adapt it a bit to my own needs and plugged it into my own site and workflow. It's a separate project hosted on a separate subdomain, so I don't *think* it counts against the scores for ericraslich.com, and I didn't want any errors when it deploys to count against me or this netlify project. You can ready Zach's project post for more info on Netlify build times and how he tries to guard them.
