title: Digital Ocean Is It
---

Digital Ocean is a great tool and I have to write about it
for this first post. My goal was to learn docker in order to launch
a work project. The provisioning of a server was incredibly simple
(relative to how complicated it is to install and run a raspberry pi
at home, I guess) and the tutorials on the Digital Ocean site were
super helpful.



It is what it is.
