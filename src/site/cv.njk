<h1 class="text-xl">Curriculum Vitae</h1>

<p class="mt-3">I love to learn, and I hope that some of the projects found on the 
<a class="border-b-2 border-blue-500 font-medium" href="/projects/">Builds</a> 
page of this site are good examples of what I've made throughout that process.
The page you're currently reading is more of a long form resume if you need
some more of the details.</p>

<p class="mt-6">Back in 2007 I completed the requirements to become an Eagle Scout. I'm
still proud of it today, and have enjoyed a lifetime of enjoying the use of 
skills I learned and friends I made and continue to make through Scouting.</p>

<p class="mt-6">In 2012 I graduated from Michigan State University with a degree in 
Zoology/Marine Biology. In the process of getting that degree, I bounced
between a lot of different majors: political science, Spanish, fish and
wildlife management, and finally marine biology. Eventually I made it out of
that place with a B.S. in Zoology with a concentration in Marine Biology.
I also hold two specializations in Natural Resources Recreation and Marine
Ecosystems Management.</p>

<p class="mt-6">2015 I started learning web development in earnest again through
freeCodeCamp and various online teachers and courses. 
<span class="text-xs">(I have my favorites if you need recommendations.)</span>
Lately I've been picking the <abbr title="MongoDB Express Vue Node">MEVN</abbr>
stack to really learn it well, but also checking in on Postgres for a SQL 
database in my quiver, Node/Express apps with Nunjucks as a "standard" server
side framework, and learning Eleventy to deliver high quality, bare minimum
static sites like this one.</p>

<p>I'm really getting interested and excited with DevOps stuff like Docker,
self-hosting (I play with Raspberry Pis), and fun nonsense like that.
I host my production sites on a Digital Ocean droplet if they need a server, or
Netlify if they are static.</p>

<p class="mt-6">I like to live simply and experiment wrecklessly with 
<span id="webdev">web technologies</span>, and <span id="fishing">fishing</span>
.</p>

<p class="mt-6">I write about fishing, learning web development, and other 
things probably.</p>
