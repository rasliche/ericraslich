<h1 class="text-xl">Garden</h1>

<div class="mt-4">
  <h2 class="font-semibold">A Discord Experiment</h2>
  <p>
    I started a <a class="border-blue-300 border-b" href="https://discord.gg/8XTrpTF">Discord server</a> to for pair programming for web developers.
    I mostly use a MEVN stack, so feel free to hop on there if you want to pair program for a bit.

<div class="mt-4">
  <h2 class="font-semibold">I'll plant something here to grow</h2>
  <p>
    I'm not sure exactly what I'll put here eventually. But it seems like a garden is something I should tend.
    I do it in real life, I'll do it here as well.

    Right now I'm really struggling to get started on a side project after a day of working on work projects.
    That doesn't feel like it is going to be a good thing. For now, I just want to let that sink in and let it move on.
    In the mean time, I am going to work harder and earlier. While my girlfriend is getting ready for work in the
    morning (she has to commute), I'll work on my side projects.
